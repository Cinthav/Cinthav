Hello, welcome to @Cinthav's GitHub profile page!

I am Christopher Inthavong, a highly motivated computer science student in my third year of college. I am eager to and showcase my skills and passion for programming.

My primary focus is on expanding my knowledge and expertise in various programming domains. I am currently exploring different fields to specialize in, aiming to find the perfect fit where I can make a significant impact.

Currently, I am curious about operating systems and will be taking a course for it soon. I am excited to embark on an in-depth exploration of this subject, further expanding my understanding and practical skills in this crucial aspect of computer science.

I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on exciting hobby projects. With my enthusiasm for video games and programming, I am particularly drawn to projects in the gaming industry. I believe collaborative efforts can lead to innovative and engaging experiences for gamers worldwide.

If you would like to connect or discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me using the contact information provided below. I am open to discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or exploring career opportunities.

## **Important note: All of the projects that I have worked on are for university projects or the VEX robotics teams that I have been on in the past. As I mentioned, use the affiliated links to reach out to me if you would like to see what I have worked on so far!**

One last note: Yes, most of this text was generated by an A.I. language model after I fed it a basic outline of things that I wanted to include and giving it a specific set of instructions.
After all, the times are changing and it's meant to be a tool to assist people. Why not use it as intended?

Hoping to be a part of a better future, truly. - Christopher Inthavong, aspiring Computer Science student.
