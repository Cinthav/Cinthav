Hello, welcome to @Cinthav's GitHub profile page!

My name is Christopher Inthavong. I am highly motivated computer science student pursuing a B.S. for Computer Science, and currently a senior. I am eager to learn new things from the different subsets in this field.

My primary focus is on expanding my knowledge and expertise in various programming domains. I am currently considering specialization in Artificial Intelligence as I take on an introductory course this semester.

I have taken courses in (but not limited to):
Operating Systems, OO Software Design and Maintenence, and more.

Technical skills and tools (not limited to, and ranging from somewhat proficient to niche use):
Java, C, Python, SQL, Go.

I also have experience with high school and university level VEX robotics (C++ based coding mainly).
- Collaborated with team members to program motors and even helped build the robots.
If you would like to connect or discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me using the contact information provided below. I am open to discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or exploring career opportunities.

## **Important note: Most of the projects that I have worked on are for university. I will not be able to share the original code, but entirely new projects based on the same specifications.**
